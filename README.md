**"Hello, world!" Example**

This is short, basic, "hello, world!" example, to start http server on 3000 port.

```javascript

  require('hunt')({
   'port': 3000
  })
  .extendController('/', function (core, router) {
    router.get('/', function (req, res) {
      res.send('Hello, world!');
    });
  })
  .startWebServer();

```

**What do you get from the box?**

Just run `npm install hunt` and you get ready to use high level nodejs framework,
that links together many preconfigured and working perfectly together modules.
This is it. *Hunt*...

-  works on latest versions of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) >=0.10.26

-  is a real event driven (by pattern [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern))
   framework build on top of [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com),
   suitable not only for creating HTTP-based web applications, but background services,
   binary protocol applications, websockets or even xmpp based applications.

-  [Mongo database](http://www.mongodb.org/) and
    [Mongoose ORM](http://mongoosejs.com/) support from the box

-  [sequelizejs](http://sequelizejs.com/) ORM for [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/),
   [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
   and [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) via official plugin - [Hunt-Sequilize](https://www.npmjs.org/package/hunt-sequilize).

-  The best sides of express.js framework are supported: routing,
   [middlewares](http://expressjs.com/api.html#middleware), controllers.
   And this is done in clever way - expressjs application can be easily
   converted to Hunt application.

-  Popular template engines are supported - [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html),
   [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/), [jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade).

-  Powerful users model to use at your application, with customizable profile, groups,
    and compatibility with majority of [passport.js](http://passportjs.org")
    strategies, custom profile data and build up with
    [Active Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)
    and [Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) patterns

-  [Redis](http://redis.io) database support from the box, with default use of it as session storage and socket.io backend.

-  Hunt applications are easy to run on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) hosting - many config values
    (mongo/redis database access URLs, etc...) are populated automatically

-  [Clustering](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cluster.html)
    by the means of nodejs build in load balancer

-  Websocket, Htmlfile, xhr-polling, jsonp-polling for real time push messages
    are supported by the means of [socket.io](http://socket.io) and works
    from the box, even with websockets working on [nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html)
    and [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-websockets#deploy)

-  [socket.io](http://socket.io/) is perfectly linked with user
    model and passportjs authorization system, so you can send realtime
    notifications to users online just like this

-  Possibility to run HuntJs as [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) - server with TLS support,
  authentication and expandable commands' list, created with help of [RAI server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/rai)


**System requirements**

-  [Linux](http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major) (this is your problem, if you want to build this package on other operating systems)
-  [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) >= 0.10.26 (version build from source is preferable, because hunt builds some dependencies from source)
-  [Redis](http://redis.io/download) >= 2.6.16
-  [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) >= 2.4.6 (optional)
-  [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) >= 5.6.16 (optional)
-  [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) >= 9.2 (optional)


**Important!**

Without understanding how [express.js framework](http://expressjs.com/) operates, including

 - concept of [app](http://expressjs.com/api.html#express),
 - concept of [middleware](http://expressjs.com/api.html#middleware) and how [it can be used](http://webapplog.com/intro-to-express-js-parameters-error-handling-and-other-middleware/)
 - concept of chaining the middlewares (this is example of adding middleware to a chain [to count users online](http://expressjs.com/guide.html#users-online))
 - concept [route](http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.VERB)

this module is hard to understand. Please, read this information above before processing with this framework.


**Deploying the HuntJS application for production**

We will post some advices and configuration examples:
